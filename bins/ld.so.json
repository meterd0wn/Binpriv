  "description": "`ld.so` is the Linux dynamic linker/loader, its filename and location might change across distributions. The proper path is can be obtained with:\n\n```\n$ strings /proc/self/exe | head -1\n/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2\n```\n\nIt's worth noting that the spawned process will be the loader, not the target executable, this might aid evasion. See https://shyft.us/posts/20230526_linux_command_proxy.html for more information.\n",
